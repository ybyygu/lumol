Lumol concepts
**************

In order to run a molecular simulation, you need two things: a description of
the system you are simulating and a set of algorithms used to propagate the
simulation. This section presents how the ``System`` and the ``Simulation``
objects work in Lumol. The ``System`` contains the full description of the
system, and the ``Simulation`` contains the algorithms used to propagate the
system.
