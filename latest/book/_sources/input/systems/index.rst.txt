***************************
The ``[[systems]]`` section
***************************

Let's talk about how you can set up your system. The system contains information
about:

- the configuration, i.e. the positions (and velocities) of your atoms;
- which atoms are connected (bonded) to form molecules;
- how atoms will interact with each other;
- and the simulation cell (i.e. volume).

All these details are listed after the ``[[systems]]`` keyword.
