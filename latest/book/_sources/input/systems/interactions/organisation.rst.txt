Organizing interactions
=======================

You can specify interactions between atoms in two ways: either inside the main
input file or in a separate file. For example take a look at the input file for
the flexible SPC water model where we put all interactions directly into our
main input file:

.. code::

    # system configuration: initial positions, topology and cell
    [[systems]]
    file = "data/water.xyz"
    topology = "topology.pdb"
    cell = 40

    # intermolecular potentials
    [[systems.potentials.pairs]]
    atoms = ["O", "O"]
    lj = {sigma = "3.165 A", epsilon = "0.155 kcal/mol"}

    [[systems.potentials.pairs]]
    atoms = ["H", "H"]
    null = {}

    [[systems.potentials.pairs]]
    atoms = ["O", "H"]
    null = {}

    # intramolecular potentials
    [[systems.potentials.bonds]]
    atoms = ["O", "H"]
    harmonic = {k = "1059.162 kcal/mol/A^2", x0 = "1.012 A"}

    [[systems.potentials.angles]]
    atoms = ["H", "O", "H"]
    harmonic = {k = "75.90 kcal/mol/deg^2", x0 = "113.24 deg"}

    # additional interactions omitted

As you can see, there is a lot of bracket notation going on here. First, in
``[[systems.potentials.xxx]]``, the ``potentials`` key is actually a nested
table of ``systems`` indicated by the dot notation. Accordingly, ``pairs``,
``bonds``, ``angles``, etc. are nested tables of ``potentials``. Second,
``harmonic = {k = "75.90 kcal/mol/deg", x0 = "113.24 deg"}`` is the notation for
an inline table.

Input files can get very big and hard to read when you simulate complex systems
with a large number of different atoms. In these scenarios it may be better to
define a separate input file for your interactions like so:

.. code::

    [[systems]]
    file = "data/water.xyz"
    topology = "topology.pdb"
    cell = 40
    potentials = "water.toml"

Here, the ``potentials`` key contains a string that is interpreted as the path
to another input file containing only definitions of interactions. This way, you
can build your own library of force field files (share them with us!).
