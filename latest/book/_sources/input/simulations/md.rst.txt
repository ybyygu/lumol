Molecular dynamics
==================

A molecular dynamics simulation is started by setting the propagator ``type`` to
``"MolecularDynamics"``. The only needed key is the ``timestep``, which is the
time step to use in the integration of forces and velocities to positions.

.. code::

    [[simulations]]
    nsteps = 1_000_000

    [simulations.propagator]
    type = "MolecularDynamics"
    timestep = "1 fs"
    integrator = {type = "BerendsenBarostat", pressure = "100 bar", timestep = 1000}
    thermostat = {type = "Berendsen", temperature = "400 K", timestep = 100}

Other options are the ``integrator`` key to use another integration scheme, the
``thermostat`` key to set a thermostat, and the ``controls`` key to add some
additional control algorithm to the simulation.

Integrators
-----------

Integrators are algorithms that propagate the forces acting on the particles to
compute their motions. The simplest ones performs an NVE integration, but some
integrators allow to work in different ensembles.  All NVE integrators can be
turned into NVT integrators by adding a :ref:`thermostat <md-thermostat>` to the
simulation. In the input, if the ``integrator`` key is absent, the default
integrator is a Velocity-Verlet integrator.

Velocity-Verlet integrator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Velocity-Verlet is the most common NVE integrator for molecular dynamics. See
this `page <velocity-verlet_>`_ for more information about the algorithm.

In the input, it can be specified by using the ``VelocityVerlet`` integrator
type:

.. code::

    [simulations.propagator]
    type = "MolecularDynamics"
    timestep = "1 fs"
    integrator = {type = "VelocityVerlet"}

.. _velocity-verlet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration#Velocity_Verlet

Verlet integrator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verlet algorithm is another simple NVE integrator. See this `page <verlet_>`_ for
more information. Most of the time, the Velocity-Verlet algorithm is preferable,
since it produces more precise velocities.

In the input, it can be specified by using the ``Verlet`` integrator type:

.. code::

    [simulations.propagator]
    type = "MolecularDynamics"
    timestep = "1 fs"
    integrator = {type = "Verlet"}

.. _verlet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration#Basic_St.C3.B6rmer.E2.80.93Verlet

Leap-Frog integrator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Leap-Frog algorithm is a third NVE integrator. See this `page <leap-frog_>`_
for details about the algorithm.

In the input, it can be specified by using the ``LeapFrog`` integrator type:

.. code::

    [simulations.propagator]
    type = "MolecularDynamics"
    timestep = "1 fs"
    integrator = {type = "LeapFrog"}

.. _leap-frog: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrog_integration

Berendsen barostat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Berendsen barostat integrator algorithm use the Berendsen barostat with a
Velocity-Verlet integrator to achieve NPT integration. It must be use together
with a thermostat, preferentially the Berendsen thermostat. See this `page
<berendsen-barostat_>`_ for more information about the algorithm.

This algorithm exists in two versions: an isotropic one and an anisotropic one.
The isotropic version of the barostat scale all the cell parameter by the same
value using the scalar pressure. The anisotropic version scale the different
cell parameters by different values, using the stress tensor instead.

In the input, the isotropic barostat can be specified by using the
``BerendsenBarostat`` integrator type:

.. code::

    [simulations.propagator]
    type = "MolecularDynamics"
    timestep = "1 fs"
    integrator = {type = "BerendsenBarostat", pressure = "100 bar", timestep = 1000}
    thermostat = {type = "Berendsen", temperature = "400 K", timestep = 100}

The ``pressure`` key specify the target pressure for the simulation, and the
``timestep`` is the relaxation time step of the barostat.

The anisotropic version of the Berendsen barostat can be specified by using the
``AnisoBerendsenBarostat`` integrator type:

.. code::

    [simulations.propagator]
    type = "MolecularDynamics"
    timestep = "1 fs"
    integrator = {type = "AnisoBerendsenBarostat", pressure = "100 bar", timestep = 1000}
    thermostat = {type = "Berendsen", temperature = "400 K", timestep = 100}

The ``pressure`` key specify the target hydrostatic pressure for the simulation,
and the ``timestep`` is the relaxation time step of the barostat.

In both cases, the barostat time step is expressed in fraction of the main
integration time step. Using a main time step of 2 fs and a barostat time step
of 1000 will yield an effective relaxation time of 2000 fs or 2 ps.

.. _md-thermostat:

Thermostats
-----------

Thermostats are algorithms used to maintain the temperature of a system at a
given value. They are specified in the input by the ``thermostat`` key.

Berendsen thermostat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Berendsen thermostat is described `here <berendsen-thermostat_>`_, and
provide a simple exponential relaxation of the temperature to a target value. In
the input, it is declared with the ``Berendsen`` thermostat type, a target
``temperature`` value, and a ``timestep``.

.. code::

    [simulations.propagator]
    type = "MolecularDynamics"
    timestep = "1 fs"
    thermostat = {type = "Berendsen", temperature = "400 K", timestep = 100}

The time step is expressed in fraction of the main integration time step, like
for the Berendsen barostat.

Rescaling thermostat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A rescaling thermostat is the simplest thermostat algorithm possible: it just
rescale all the velocities to set the temperature to the wanted value. It can be
useful for equilibration as it converges quickly. In the input, it is specified
by the ``Rescale`` thermostat type, a target ``temperature`` value, and a
``tolerance`` value. The tolerance value is optional, and is used to let the
system fluctuate around the wanted temperature: while the instant temperature is
inside the ``[temperature - tolerance : temperature + tolerance]`` range, no
rescale happen.

.. code::

    [simulations.propagator]
    type = "MolecularDynamics"
    timestep = "1 fs"
    thermostat = {type = "Rescale", temperature = "250 K", tolerance = "10 K"}

Controls
--------

Control algorithm are supplementary steps that modify the system to ensure some
invariant, or apply some constraint. They are specified in the ``controls``
array, by giving a control ``type``. The ``every`` key specifies that the
algorithm should only be run every ``n`` step of the simulation (optional,
defaults to 1).

.. code::

    [simulations.propagator]
    type = "MolecularDynamics"
    timestep = "1 fs"
    controls = [
        # Remove global rotation of the system every 4 timestep
        {type = "RemoveRotation", every = 4}
    ]

-  The ``RemoveTranslation`` control removes the global system rotation;
-  The ``RemoveRotation`` control removes the global system translation.
-  The ``Rewrap`` control rewraps all molecules' centers of mass to lie within
   the unit cell. Individual atoms in a molecule may still lie outside of the
   cell.
