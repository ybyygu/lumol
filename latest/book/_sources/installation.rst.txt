Installation
************

Lumol is written in `rust`_ (:ref:`why? <faq-why-rust>`), and you will need a
Rust compiler to compile it. You can find rust installation instructions `here
<rust-install_>`_, or use your system package manager. Lumol also depends on
some C++ libraries, so you will need a C++ compiler and CMake to be installed.

Lumol is tested on Linux and OS X, and should build on Windows without any
issue. You will need a C++11 capable compiler on Windows (MSVC > 15 or Mingw
with gcc > 4.9). Be sure to pick the corresponding version of the Rust compiler.

When all the dependencies are installed on you system, you can install the
the latest development version with:

.. code-block:: bash

    cargo install --git https://github.com/lumol-org/lumol

This command will download and install lumol in ``~/.cargo/bin/lumol``, where
``~`` is your home directory. You may want to add ``~/.cargo/bin`` to your PATH
or move the ``lumol`` binary in another directory accessible in your PATH.

You can check that the installation worked by running

.. code-block:: bash

    lumol --version

.. _rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/
.. _rust-install: https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html
